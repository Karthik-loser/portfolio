        Depending on how you obtained the Windows software, this is a license agreement between (1)you and the device manufacturer or software installer that distributes the software with your device; or (2) you and Microdoft Corperation if you acquired the software from a retailer. Microsoft is the device manufacturer for devices produced by Microsoft or one of its affilates, and Microsoft is the retailer if you acquired the software directed from Microsoft. Note that if you are a volume license customer, use of this software is subject to your volume license agreement rather than this agreement.
