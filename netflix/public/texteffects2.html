    <p>The first line tells Python that we are defining a new function and we are naming 
        it hello. The following lines are indented to show that they are part of the hello 
        function. (Note: Some shells will print ellipses [" ... "] at the beginning of the 
        indented lines). The blank line at the end (obtained by hitting the <Enter> key 
        twice) lets Python know that the definition is finished, and the shell responds 
        with another prompt. Notice that typing the definition did not cause Python to 
        print anything yet. We have told Python what should happen when the hello 
        function is used as a command; we haven't actually asked Python to perform it 
        yet.</p>
